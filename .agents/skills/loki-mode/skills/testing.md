## E2E Testing with Playwright MCP

**Use Playwright MCP for browser-based testing.**

```python
# E2E test after feature implementation
Task(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    model="sonnet",
    description="Run E2E tests for auth flow",
    prompt="""Use Playwright MCP to test:
    1. Navigate to /login
    2. Fill email and password fields
    3. Click submit button
    4. Verify redirect to /dashboard
    5. Check user name appears in header

    Use accessibility tree refs, not coordinates."""
)
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use accessibility tree refs instead of coordinates
- Test critical user flows after each feature
- Capture screenshots for error states
- Run after unit tests, before deployment

## Property-Based Testing (Kiro Pattern)

**Auto-generate edge case tests from specifications.**

```yaml
property_based_testing:
  purpose: "Verify code meets spec constraints with hundreds of random inputs"
  tools: "fast-check (JS/TS), hypothesis (Python), QuickCheck (Haskell)"

  extract_properties_from:
    - OpenAPI schema: "minLength, maxLength, pattern, enum, minimum, maximum"
    - Business rules: "requirements.md invariants"
    - Data models: "TypeScript interfaces, DB constraints"

  examples:
    - "email field always matches email regex"
    - "price is never negative"
    - "created_at <= updated_at always"
    - "array length never exceeds maxItems"
```

**When to use:**
- After implementing API endpoints (validate against OpenAPI)
- After data model changes (validate invariants)
- Before deployment (edge case regression)

## Event-Driven Hooks (Kiro Pattern)

**Trigger quality checks on file operations, not just at phase boundaries.**

```yaml
hooks_system:
  location: "autonomy/hooks/"

  triggers:
    on_file_write:
      - lint: "npx eslint --fix {file}"
      - typecheck: "npx tsc --noEmit"
      - secrets_scan: "detect-secrets scan {file}"

    on_task_complete:
      - contract_test: "npm run test:contract"
      - spec_lint: "spectral lint .loki/specs/openapi.yaml"

    on_phase_complete:
      - memory_consolidate: "Extract patterns to semantic memory"
      - metrics_update: "Log efficiency scores"
      - checkpoint: "git commit with phase summary"
```

**Benefits:**
- Catches issues 5-10x earlier than phase-end review
- Reduces rework cycles
- Aligns with Constitutional AI (continuous self-critique)

## Visual Design Input

**When given design mockups or screenshots:**

1. **Discovery Phase:** Extract visual requirements from mockups
2. **Development Phase:** Implement UI matching design specs
3. **QA Phase:** Visual regression testing with Playwright screenshots
4. **Verification:** Compare screenshots against original designs

```python
# Capture screenshot for comparison
Task(
    model="sonnet",
    description="Visual regression test",
    prompt="""Use Playwright MCP to:
    1. Navigate to implemented feature
    2. Capture screenshot
    3. Compare against design mockup at designs/feature.png
    4. Report visual differences"""
)
```

## Test Strategy by Phase

| Phase | Test Type | Tool |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Development | Unit tests | Haiku (parallel) |
| Development | Integration tests | Sonnet |
| QA | E2E tests | Playwright MCP |
| QA | Property-based tests | fast-check/hypothesis |
| Pre-deployment | Full regression | All of above |

## Review-to-Memory Learning

**Pipe code review findings into semantic memory to prevent repeat mistakes.**

```yaml
review_learning:
  trigger: "After every code review cycle"

  workflow:
    1. Complete 3-reviewer blind review
    2. Aggregate findings by severity
    3. For each Critical/High/Medium finding:
       - Extract pattern description
       - Document prevention strategy
       - Save to .loki/memory/semantic/anti-patterns/
    4. Link to episodic memory for traceability

  output_format:
    pattern: "Using any instead of proper TypeScript types"
    category: "type-safety"
    severity: "high"
    prevention: "Always define explicit interfaces for API responses"
```
