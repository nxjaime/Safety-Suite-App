# Help Center Documentation

## Purpose
This guide defines how teams should use SafetyHub Connect support features and provide actionable product feedback.

## 1. Daily Workflow
1. Open `Status Board` to review current safety and operations signals.
2. Resolve urgent `Tasks` and active compliance items.
3. Review driver risk and coaching priorities.
4. Confirm maintenance and work-order status.

## 2. Help & Support Process
- Use the in-app Help section for operating guidance and platform workflows.
- For urgent production-impact incidents, follow your internal escalation process first.
- Log the incident details in Help & Feedback so it enters the product backlog.

## 3. Feedback Submission Standard
When submitting feedback, include:
- Category: Bug, Feature Request, Usability, Performance, or General.
- Priority: Low, Medium, or High.
- Message quality: at least 8 characters with expected vs actual behavior and business impact.

## 4. Backlog Management
- Backlog entries can be exported as CSV for sprint planning and prioritization.
- Entries can be deleted when duplicated or no longer relevant.
- Keep backlog records concise and specific.

## 5. Admin Access Notes
- Admin dashboard is role-gated.
- Use least-privilege access by default.
- Only grant admin where operationally required.

## 6. Troubleshooting
- If feedback submit fails, verify account organization mapping and session status.
- If admin access is missing, sign out/in and verify role assignment.
- If issues persist, capture timestamp, route, and browser details in a feedback entry.
